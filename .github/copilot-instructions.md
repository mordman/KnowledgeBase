# Copilot Instructions for KnowledgeBase

## Project Overview
This is a personal knowledge base repository for fullstack development learning materials, organized hierarchically under `IT/Developer/FullStack/`. Content is primarily in Russian (RU) with some English (EN) sections. It includes documentation, roadmaps, interview questions, prompts, test tasks, and job vacancies.

## Structure and Organization
- **RU/EN**: Language-specific folders for content.
- **Docs**: Technical documentation by topic (e.g., `Architecture/`, `C#/`, `DataBase/`).
- **RoadMaps**: Learning paths and schemas.
- **Questions**: Interview and exam questions, categorized by topic.
- **Promts**: LLM prompts for interviews and other uses.
- **TestTasks**: Coding challenges and assignments.
- **Vacancies**: Job postings with requirements, named as `LangProg.Company.Job.md`.

## Content Formatting Conventions
- Use Markdown with structured sections (headers, lists, tables).
- For technical docs, include tables for requirements/examples (see [CleanArchitecture.md](IT/Developer/FullStack/RU/Docs/Architecture/CleanArchitecture.md)).
- Embed code examples in fenced blocks with language specifiers (e.g., ```csharp).
- Use relative links for internal references.
- Maintain consistent Russian for RU content, English for EN.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Add new topics under appropriate subfolders in `Docs/`.
- For vacancies, follow naming: `LangProg.Company.Job.md` (e.g., `C#.Microsoft.FullstackDeveloper.md`).
- Update roadmaps in `RoadMaps/` to reflect new learning paths.
- Ensure content is actionable and includes examples from real-world scenarios.

## Workflows
- Edit files directly in VS Code; no build process required.
- Use Git for version control: commit changes with descriptive messages.
- No automated tests; manually verify links and formatting.
